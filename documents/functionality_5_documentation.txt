This code takes an integer as input and returns true if the number is a square number and false if other wise. It first checks if the input number is negative, which is not a valid square number. Then, it calculates the square root of the input number using the Math.sqrt method and casts it to an Integer using (int) since we only want to check if the square root is an integer. Finally, it checks if the square of the square root is equal to the input number, which confirms if the input number is a square number.
