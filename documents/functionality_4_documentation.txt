The isFibonacciSequence method takes an array of integers as input and returns a boolean array indicating whether each number in the input array is the Fibonacci sequence or not. It calls the isFibonacci method for each number in the input array to determine if it is in the sequence or not. Then the method checks the integer as input and returns a boolean value indicating wether it is in the Fibonacci sequence or not from the isFibonacci Method.
